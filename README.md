# U^2-Net (U Square Net)
Implementation of U^2-Net((U Square Net)) architecture in TensorFlow for salient object detection and segmentation.

This repository is based on the following paper : 

![U^2-Net: Going Deeper with Nested U-Structure for Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09007.pdf)

The model is being trained on the ECSSD dataset.
